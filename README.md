# Email Spam Detection

Welcome to the **Email Spam Detection** project! This project uses machine learning to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" (also known as "ham"). The goal is to build a model that can automatically detect and filter out spam emails from a dataset.

## Introduction

Spam detection is a critical problem for email service providers. Automatically filtering out unwanted or malicious emails improves the user experience and protects users from phishing attacks or fraud. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect spam emails based on the content of the emails.

The project uses Python with libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **NLTK** for text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Build a spam detection classifier that can differentiate between spam and ham emails.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using common classification metrics.
- Implement basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze the email text.

## Dataset

For this project, we use a publicly available dataset of labeled emails. The dataset includes:

- **Spam emails**: Emails identified as unsolicited or potentially harmful (phishing, ads, etc.).
- **Ham emails**: Legitimate emails that are not considered spam.

You can use datasets like the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** or **Enron Email Dataset**, or download other email datasets from sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). In this project, the dataset should include columns for the email content and its label (spam or ham).

## Features and Preprocessing

### Feature Extraction

- **Text Data**: Emails are primarily text data, so we extract features like words, frequency of words, and combinations of words.
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: A technique where we represent the email text as a collection of word frequencies.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Used to measure the importance of words in the email across the entire dataset.

### Text Preprocessing

Before training the model, the email text needs to be preprocessed. Steps include:

1. **Lowercasing**: Convert all text to lowercase to standardize.
2. **Removing Stopwords**: Common words like "the", "is", "in", etc., are removed.
3. **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words or tokens.
4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
5. **Removing Punctuation and Numbers**: Strip non-alphabetic characters to focus on meaningful words.

## Modeling

We experimented with several machine learning algorithms to classify the emails:

1. **Naive Bayes** (MultinomialNB): A simple yet effective algorithm commonly used for text classification tasks.
2. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary classification.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm that tries to find the best boundary between classes.
4. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method based on decision trees.

### Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified emails.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations (spam) to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positives to all actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A summary of the prediction results for each class.
